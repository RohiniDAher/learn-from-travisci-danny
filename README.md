# learn-from-travisci-danny
using DannyDainton's github project for postman-travisci-example
From Danny:
A very simple project to demonstrate using Newman to run a Postman collection through TravisCI.
The collection and environment files have been taken from the All-Things-Postman Repo.
In order to use TravisCI in you're own projects 
you will need to signup and then sync it to your Github account.
